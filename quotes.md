“The truth which makes men free is for the most part the truth which men prefer not to hear.“ - **Herbert Agar**

"I think folks would be surprised by how many people are very touched to hear from a young person. It’s always clear to me, when I meet someone young, if they’re going to do it or not. It requires a certain self-possession that I immediately recognize"  - **Brady Corbet**

" 'A nation,' he heard himself say, 'consists of its laws. A nation does not consist of its situation at a given time. If an individual’s morals are situational, that individual is without morals. If a nation’s laws are situational, that nation has no laws, and soon isn’t a nation.' " – **William Gibson**

“I ignore polling as a method of government. I think that shows a certain weakness of mind - an inability to chart a course whichever way the wind blows, whichever way the media encourages the people to go, you follow. If you can't force or are unwilling to force your people to follow you, with or without threats, you are not a leader.” - **Lee Kuan Yew**
