_“The truth which makes men free is for the most part the truth which men prefer not to hear.“_ - **Herbert Agar**

_"I think folks would be surprised by how many people are very touched to hear from a young person. It’s always clear to me, when I meet someone young, if they’re going to do it or not. It requires a certain self-possession that I immediately recognize"_  - **Brady Corbet**
